## The Game

- The game show the name of a color, but the name will be colored with another color.
- The user has to answer the correct color (based on the name and not the text color).
- The game continue while the user answered right.

## Goals of my work

- Learn more about how to use Redux in a server-side redering mode
- Learn more how to make server-side rendering with React (and learn more React too...)
- Learn more about Webpack (universal JavaScript)
- Make some machine learning (try to find the best patterns to win against the user)
